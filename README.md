# Toast--

Less toast, fewer problems

## Installation

Pre-built binaries are provided for a number of platforms.

### MATLAB

The TOAST matlab binaries are built using MATLAB 2020a on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It
is expected that the binaries will work on newer versions, but compilation from source
may be required for older installations.

Download a release for the appropriate platform and unzip the folder in a convenient 
location. Start matlab and change to the folder, then run:

```>> toast_setup```

This script will configure the appropriate include paths. Save these paths to make the
installation permanent. Check your installation by running one of the included demos:

```>> demo toolbox toast``
